###Input###
#Need only one input, the processed output from process_mitchell_rawdatacubes.py.
#   (But, we might change the IO at some point so the processing step does not
#   duplicate the old data, and only saves the processed stuff, in which case
#   we will need to add separate inputs for the raw datacube and processing output.
