### Note that this parameter file MUST have e.g. NGC1600 as the first ###
### 7 characters of the filename when it is used in an actual run.    ###
### (For example, rename to NGC1600_s2_bin_mitchell_params).          ###
### All output is stored in the same directory as the parameter file. ###

### Input ###
#Need three input files:
#   the processed output from s1_process_mitchell.py.
#      (But, we might change the IO at some point so the processing step does not
#      duplicate the old data, and only saves the processed stuff, in which case
#      we will need to add separate inputs for the raw datacube and processing output.
#   target positions file from Jenny
#   list of bad fibers (chosen by hand after looking at process_mitchell output)
#Also need to choose desired aspect ratio and signal to noise.

proc_mitchell_cube	../all_my_output/NGC1600/NGC1600-s1-run1-mitchellcube.fits
target_positions_path	../all_my_input/target-positions.txt
bad_fibers_path		../all_my_output/NGC1600/NGC1600_bad_fiber_list.txt

### Settings ###
#Two general settings, three binning-related settings:
#   skip_rerun: 'no' will overwrite old output, 'yes' will do plot only (if possible)
#   run_name: any string, e.g. 'test1' or 'nobadfibers', to be included in filenames
#   aspect_ratio: limits how skinny (thin arcs or thin pizza slices) bins can be
#   s2n_threshold: minimum signal to noise for each bin
#   bin_type: 'folded' or 'unfolded'

skip_rerun		no
run_name		run1
aspect_ratio		1.5
s2n_threshold		20
bin_type		folded
crop_min		3650
crop_max		5650
