class SpectrumSet(object):
    """
    This class holds a set of spectra along with their metadata.

    The metadata are the focus here - this class mainly serves to
    enforce that all of the information needed to interpret spectra is
    explicitly recorded along with the spectral data. The included
    methods for I/O and manipulation of spectra are meant to enforce
    the preservation and automatic updating of the metadata as needed.
