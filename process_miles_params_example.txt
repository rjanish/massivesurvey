###Input###
#Need 3 items from the miles website:
#   folder containing the raw spectra (e.g. m0001V) and nothing else
#   index file (probably paramsMILES_v9.1.txt)
#   value of the ir

path_milesraw_spectra	../all_my_input/raw-miles/MILES_library_v9.1/
path_milesraw_index	../all_my_input/raw-miles/paramsMILES_v9.1.txt
library_fwhm		2.5		

###Output###
#Specify the folder where you want the script's output to go, but note the 
#   folder should not exist yet!
#The items within the folder (spectra, catalog.txt, ir.txt) should not be
#   renamed, because the module to read the template library expects these
#   names (which are hard-coded in).
